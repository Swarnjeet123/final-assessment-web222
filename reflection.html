  <h1>Reflection:</h1>
   <h4>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean? </h4>
   <p>Responsive layout is a technique to net web page introduction that uses bendy layouts, bendy snap shots and cascading fashion sheet media queries. 
 The intention of responsive layout is to construct net pages that come across the visitor`s display screen length and orientation and extrade the format accordingly.
Responsive layout is a fairly unfashionable technique to website design that solves a whole lot of layout issues due to the proliferation of recent forms of cell devices. Responsive layout pages use X and Y coordinates on a grid for format and mathematical chances for snap shots in preference to fixed-width parameters. Using chances in preference to fixed-width parameters and a grid format creates a greater fluid format with a view to resize itself to healthy the scale of the display.</p>
<h4>How does responsive design relate to web technologies? </h4>
<p>Responsive design is a graphic user interface (GUI) design approach used to create content that adjusts smoothly to various screen sizes. Designers size elements in relative units (%) and apply media queries, so their designs can automatically adapt to the browser space to ensure content consistency across devices(https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-web-application).</p>
<h4>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research? </h4>
<p>There are various aspects that are learned from building web apps for different devices through your research.
Updates are imported centrally, so your web application is always up to date. 
All users have access to the same version, avoiding compatibility issues. 
You can access your web application from anywhere using your web browser. 
Web applications can run on multiple platforms, regardless of  operating system or device, as long as your browser is compatible. 
Web applications relieve developers of the responsibility of creating clients that are compatible with a particular type of computer or operating system. 
Web applications reduce software piracy in subscription-based web applications(https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-web-application).

It is a great learning experience and enjoyed the course and valuable course material. It has given me a great learning about the different aspect of the web pages. It is a great learning experience and hope it will definitely be helpful in my professional carrier. I know this thing that it is very important for the businesses to have their own technology enabled interactive platform where user can interact to the system and provide good understanding of various different aspects. It will help in having better relationship with the customers. Web is the most suitable and easy option for the user for interaction purpose.
